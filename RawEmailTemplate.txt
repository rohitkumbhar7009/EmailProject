							The 2 Types of Shortcodes
							
There  are primarily two types of shortcodes in WordPress.

An informational image showing the 2 Types of Shortcodes: Self-closing and Enclosing. Both can be with and without attributes.
Self-closing and Enclosing shortcodes can be valid with or without attributes.
Self-closing Shortcodes: These don’t need a closing tag.
Example: The gallery shortcode doesn’t need a closing tag. We add everything it needs with different attributes.

Enclosing Shortcodes: These need a closing tag. Enclosing shortcodes generally manipulate the content between the opening and closing tags.
Example: The caption shortcode is used to wrap a caption around any content. It’s mainly used to add a caption to images, but it works with any HTML element.
